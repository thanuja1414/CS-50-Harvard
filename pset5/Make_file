-> Make a file 

-> Problem set 5 CS-50

 ---------------------
 
 The line below defines a variable called CC that specifies that make should use clang for   compiling.

 CC = clang
------------------------

 The line below defines a variable called CFLAGS that specifies, in turn, that clang should  use some flags, most of which should look familiar.

 CFLAGS = -fsanitize=integer -fsanitize=undefined -ggdb3 -O0 -Qunused-arguments -std=c11 - Wall -Werror -Wextra -Wno-sign-compare -Wshadow

--------------------------

 The line below defines a variable called EXE, the value of which will be our program’s name.

EXE = speller

-------------------------

The line below defines a variable called HDRS, the value of which is a space-separated list of header files used by speller.

HDRS = dictionary.h

-------------------------

The line below defines a variable called LIBS, the value of which is should be a space-separated list of libraries, each of which should be prefixed with -l. (Recall our use of -lcs50 earlier this term.) Odds are you won’t need to enumerate any libraries for this problem, but we’ve included the variable just in case.

LIBS =

--------------------------

The line below defines a variable called SRCS, the value of which is a space-separated list of C files that will collectively implement speller.

SRCS = speller.c dictionary.c

----------------------------

The line below defines a variable called OBJS, the value of which is identical to that of SRCS, except that each file’s extension is not .c but .o.

OBJS = $(SRCS:.c=.o)

-----------------------------

The lines below define a "target" using these variables that tells make how to compile speller.

$(EXE): $(OBJS) Makefile
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $(OBJS) $(LIBS)

-------------------------------

The line below specifies that our .o files all "depend on" dictionary.h and Makefile so that changes to either induce recompilation of the former when you run make.

$(OBJS): $(HDRS) Makefile

--------------------------------

Finally, the lines below define another target for cleaning up this problem’s directory.

clean:
    rm -f core $(EXE) *.o
----------------------------------
